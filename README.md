# w05d02:  Cheesy Create!

## Task:
- create a `show` page that renders individual cheeses by id.
- create a `new` page that renders a form for the user to create a new cheese.
- The form on the `new` page should send a `POST` request to `/cheeses` and add a new cheese to the database.  After the cheese is added, redirect the user to the new cheese's show page.
